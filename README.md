# ClanQuest
ClanQuest - The 2D Adventure game from VRF Studios

Story ideas:
You just woke up after a long night and are horrified to discover that your clan is unprepared for the big Day 1 raid race!

Help your clanmates prepare and get ready by solving puzzles and hunting for the missing items
they need so you can all crush it and get World's First!

Characters:      Issue:
You              Your fireteam needs help (first challenge is getting your chores done and other calamity)
GreenSkull       No mic (cannot talk)
Synyster         Under DDoS attack (no internet)
HopOnDeez        Suffering from intense allergies (needs allergy medicine)
Royer            Needs maple cookies (he's hungry and he HATES maple stuff -- therein lies the joke)
DeathShooter     Xbox will not turn on

Style:
Low-res graphics clickable (?) adventure, like Space Quest 4, but REALLY basic graphics
